🧠 Mental Health Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes mental health trends in the workplace using survey data. The aim is to uncover how factors like geography, job type, physical health, and company policies affect mental health and treatment-seeking behavior among employees.

🎯 Problem Statement
